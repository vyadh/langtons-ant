Langton's Ant
=============

A exploration of JavaFX with FXML, Lambda's and Steams for implementing
Langton's Ant.

This version is a branch from the main project intended to help train
people for learning lambdas and streams.

Features
--------

* Multiple ants
* Multiple colours (levels of grey)
* Heat-map style shading (by repeating patterns, see example below)
* Arbitrary turn strategies (such as LLRR or RRLLLRLLLRRR)

Examples
--------

Once you are done with the examples on Wikipedia, here are some other nice
ones to try. Some of these take a while to work, so set the FPS setting to max.

 * LRLRLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLLRLRLRLRLR
